title: Avatar A Week 2
---

Last week, we focused on making a minimal demo implementing some basic features, most notably networking. Beyond getting to a smooth in-game 2-player experience, we only had button-based controls for shooting fireballs and an avatar with only hands/head animated using inverse kinematics.

This week, we added more features central to the gameplay experience, including:

- Gesture-based controls for shooting fireballs: We added a basic "punch" gesture. While we still use the grip trigger on the Touch controller for marking the beginning/ending of a gesture, we will work towards removing that entirely if at all possible. There is also some room for improvement for the intuitiveness / learning curve of aiming.

- Non-standard movement: We want to have a large playing field for combat, but this conflicts with practical considerations (such as the Rift's tracking range and player stamina).

- Movement animations: Although we are using inverse kinematics for greater visual clarity in seeing the enemy player's movements (which will be critical given that actions are gesture-based), given our non-standard movement controls and the Rift's lack of full-body tracking, we added traditional animations similar to those found in non-VR 3D games.

- Terrain: We added some basic terrain, which not only improves aesthetics, but also adds some gameplay variety (e.g. altitude differences) and improves player awareness of their location.

- Hit points (HP): We implemented an HP system, with health bars indicating the HP of both players. Fireballs currently do 10 damage.

And of course, since this is a 2-player game, all of the above features are appropriately synchronized for both players via networking.
